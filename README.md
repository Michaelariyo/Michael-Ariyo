# Michael-Ariyo
Started my journey into IT, first as a Scrum Master, I realised to be an effective part of a team having a good tech basis was non-negotiable. I am currently on a Help Desk earning and learning my way up. Learning to be a full stack developer to solve a multitude of issues. Please feel free to engage with me and give pointers as often as you can :)
